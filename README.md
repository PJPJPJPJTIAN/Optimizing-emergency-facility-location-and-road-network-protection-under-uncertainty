The provided code snippets are associated with the research titled "Optimizing Emergency Facility Location and Road Network Protection to Mitigate Disaster Response Times Under Uncertainty." Within this study, we have developed four precise algorithms tailored to the proposed model. As part of our practical applications, we offer two illustrative case studies. In this context, we furnish the code implementations for the four algorithms, specifically designed to address the smaller case study. This manual solvability serves the purpose of facilitating readers in acquiring a more profound comprehension of the solution methodologies employed by these four algorithms.
In the provided HTML documents, readers can download these documents and promptly observe the results. Furthermore, readers have the option to copy the code snippets and execute them on their Python platforms for further exploration and experimentation.
